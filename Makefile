# This Makefile is simply for development purposes. Normally, when this package
# is imported, Go will build the ./c/sqlite.c file that is included directly by
# static.go. However this is pretty slow ~30s. When developing this is very
# annoying. Use this Makefile to pre-build the sqlite3.o object and then build
# the package with the build tag link, which will ignore static.go and
# use link.go instead to link against sqlite.o. This reduces compilation times
# down to < 3 sec!
#
# If you are using an editor that builds the project as you work on it, you'll
# want to build the sqlite3.o object and tell your editor to use the
# link go build tag when working on this project.
# For vim-go, use the command `GoBuildTags link` or
# 	`let g:go_build_tags = # 'link'`
